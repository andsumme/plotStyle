Repository for PBHL-B581 Final Project IU-Indianapolis

For my final project for this class, I chose to make custom graphing functions that coincide `ggplot2`.
Called `plotStyle`, these functions allow for ease in making plots ready for publication, streamlining the process for new or existing R users.

Please see Vignette for detailed description of `plotStyle`, the motivation behind it, and how to download.
